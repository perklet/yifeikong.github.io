<p>as pointed by one hacker news comment, it's a very competitive market, however you don't have to own the whole market, a small share is just profitable.</p>

<p>Kudos to you guys for building this. There is always a lot of scepticism from people on "why would anyone pay for this" . Reality is not everyone has the time or resources to build their own kit. There are literally 1000s of businesses on the internet that that are in the business of selling "time" or timesavers and removing the risk of maintenance, ongoing support.
Keep improving this and with the rise of web personalization, the demand will continue to grow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just some rough calculations. Assuming the worst-case scenario, everyone in the highest tiers (the cheapest per request), 250M daily requests means he makes
400 * 250M / 320K = $312,500 per month.
Or $3.75M per year.
Not counting the expenses.</p>

<p>I think the most common business model for a website such as this is to offer premium services like:
1) more accurate details
2) fraud protection, if the ip is known for fraud or spamming
3) increased rate limits, etc
Just the top of my head s.. I'm sure you i can think of many more..</p>

<p>I use ipinfo.io mostly to see my own public facing IP address and for me, it's 2 reasons:
- I somehow can remember that domain. I don't have to google "my ip" and dig through weird domains that change all the time
- The design is clean and simple. Not too many information, no ads, loads fast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has worked well for me, too. I saw an influx of "How to offer a time-based trial version on Android" on SO and developed a trial SDK as an answer: https://www.trialy.io/</p>
